# Zero values or feature means?

Comparison of the NA replacement methods

## Abstract

We will compare two methods of the data empty values replacement. We will build the generator of correlated data. We will expand the functionality of the generator with the noise data creation.
During the experiment with the data of different quality, we will achieve the fix method to accuracy dependency.

We will prove that both methods are equivalent. We will find the epoch parameter to shape dependency. We will find the epoch parameter to noise amount dependency.
